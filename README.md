App Title: "pic-a-color"

Elevator Pitch:
Do you suffer from indecisiveness? Do simple tasks take you too long to do because you’re not able to make quick decisions? Well, I don’t have an all-inclusive solution for you but I do have something that might make your life a tad easier. If you’re a frequent nail artist or have been avoiding painting your nails to avoid having to pick a nail polish color, I have a solution for you: pic-a-color. This app lets you randomly generate a nail polish color based on a database of colors, or lets you pick from your own local selection of colors. Additional features coming soon!
